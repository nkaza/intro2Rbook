```

For many people, using R to create informative and pretty figures is one of the more rewarding aspects of using R. These can either take the form of a rough and ready plot to get a feel for what's going on in your data, or a fancier, more complex figure to use in a publication or a report. This process is often as close as many scientists get to having a professional creative side (at least that's true for us), and it's a source of pride for some folk.

As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the many reasons for the rise in the popularity of R is its ability to produce publication quality figures. Not only can R users make figures well suited for publication, but the means in which the figures are produced also offers a wide-range of customisation. This in turn allows users to create their own particular styles and brands of figures which are well beyond the cookie-cutter styles in more traditional point and click software. Because of this inherent flexibility when producing figures, data visualisation in R and supporting packages has grown substantially over the years.

In this Chapter, we will focus on creating figures using a specialised package called `ggplot2`.

Before we get going with making some plots of the `gg` variety, how about a quick history of one of the most commonly used packages in R? `ggplot2`\index{ggplot2 package} was based on a book called *Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson (hence the gg in `ggplot2`). See [here][leland-summary] for an interesting summary of Wilkinson's book.

The *Grammar of Graphics* approach moves away from the idea that to create, for example, a scatterplot, users should click the `scatterplot` button or use the `scatterplot()` function. Instead, by breaking figures down into their various components (e.g. the underlying statistics, the geometric arrangement, the theme), users will be able to manipulate each of these components (i.e. layers) and produce a tailor-made figure fit for their specific needs.

Contrast this approach with the one used by, for example, Microsoft Excel. The user specifies the data and then clicks the scatterplot button. This inherently locks the user into many choices made by the software developer and not the user.

 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap = "framework behind ggplot2"}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/full_connected.png")
```

 

While Wilkinson would eventually go on to become vice-president of SPSS, his (and his oft forgotten co-author's) ideas would, never-the-less, make their way into R via `ggplot2` as well as other implementations (e.g. tableau).

In 2007 `ggplot2` was released by Hadley Wickham. By 2017 the package had reportedly been downloaded 10 million times and over the last few years `ggplot2` has become the foundation for numerous other packages which expand its functionality even more. `ggplot2` is now part of the [tidyverse][tidyverse] collection of R packages.

It's important to note that `ggplot2` is not **required** to make "fancy" and informative figures in R. If you prefer using base R graphics then feel free to continue as almost all `ggplot2` type figures can be created using base R (we often use either approach depending on what we're doing). The difference between`ggplot2` and base R is how you *get* to the end product rather than any substantial differences in the end product itself. This is, never-the-less, a common belief probably due to the fact that making a moderately attractive figure is (in our opinion at least), easier to do with `ggplot2` as many aesthetic decisions are made for the user, without you necessarily even knowing that a decision was ever made!

With that in mind, let's get started making some figures.

## Beginning at the end

The approach we'll use in this Chapter will be to start off by showing you a figure which we suggest is at a standard that you could use in a poster or presentation. Using that as the aim, we will then work towards it step-by-step. You should not view this final figure as any sort of holy grail. For instance, you would be very unlikely to use this in a publication (you'd be much more likely to use some results from your hard earned-analysis). Regardless, this "final figure" is, and will only ever be, a reflection of what our personal preferences are. As with anything subjective, you may well disagree, and to some extent we hope you do. Much better that we all have slightly (or grossly) different views on what a good figure is - otherwise we may as well go back to using cookie-cutter figures.

So what's the figure we're going to make together?

 

```{r final-figure-start, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
nola_str_tib <- read_csv("data/NOLA_STR.csv",
												 	col_types = cols(
												 	`Permit Number` = col_character(),
												 	`Address` = col_character(),
												 	`Permit Type` = col_factor(),
												 	`Current Status` = col_factor(),
												 	`Application Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
												 	`Issue_Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")
												 )) 
	

library(ggplot2)

df <- nola_str_tib %>% filter(`Current Status` != "Duplicate")


theme_deon <- function(base_size = 15, base_family = "", base_line_size = base_size / 22, 
                        base_rect_size = base_size / 22) {
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 15),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    axis.line = element_line(size = 1, colour = "black"),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#cddcdd"),
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA, size = 0.5),
    strip.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.position = 'bottom'
  )
}

final_figure <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								labs(shape = "Permit\nType", 
  										colour = "Permit\nType") +
									scale_colour_manual(
    									values = c("#5C1AAE", "#AE5C1A", "#1AAE5C")) +
  								theme_deon()

final_figure
```

 

This is not an interesting figure. But it is illustrative of some of the things you can do with ggplot. On the y axes of the four plots we have the maximum number of bedrooms, and on the x axes we have the maximum number of guests. Each column of plots shows the Residential Subtype (N/A for non-residential). Each row of plots identifies which the permit is issued or is pending..

The different coloured points within each plot represent different types of permit. For example, data points coloured purple and green were commercial permits while the brown points are residential permits.

We have also added four trend lines to each plot.

## The start of the end

The first step in producing a plot with `ggplot()`\index{ggplot()} is the easiest! We just need to install and then make the package avaialble. Use the skills you learnt in [Chapter 1](#packages) to install and load the package. Note that although most people refer to the package as `ggplot`, it's proper name is `ggplot2`.

```{r installing-loading-ggplot, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

With that taken care of, let's make our first `ggplot`!

### The purest of ggplots

When we run our 'in person' R courses that accompany this book, we often ask our students to name all of the functions they have either learnt during the course, have heard of previously, or have used before (we call it R bingo!). At this point in the course, the students have not yet learnt about `ggplot2`, but never-the-less one year a student suggested the function `ggplot()`. When asked what the `ggplot()` function does, they joked that it obviously makes a `ggplot.` This makes intuitive sense, so let's make a `ggplot` now:

```{r pure-ggplot, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot()
```

And here we have it. A fully formed, perfect `ggplot`. We may have a small issue though. Some puritan data visualisers/plotists/figurines make the claim that figures should include some form of information beyond a light grey background. As loathe as we are to agree with purists, we'll do so here. We really should include some information, but to do so, we need data.

We'll keep using the `nola_str_tib` dataset that you've used in [Chapter 3](#data_r). Let's have a quick reminder of what the structure of the data looks like. For the sake of simplicity, I will drop the observations that are duplicate and are thus noted in the `Current Status`.

```{r str-of-flower, collapse=TRUE}
nola_str_tib <- read_csv("data/NOLA_STR.csv",
												 	col_types = cols(
												 	`Permit Number` = col_character(),
												 	`Address` = col_character(),
												 	`Permit Type` = col_factor(),
												 	`Current Status` = col_factor(),
												 	`Application Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
												 	`Issue_Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")
												 )) 
	

library(ggplot2)

str(nola_str_tib)

df <- nola_str_tib %>% filter(`Current Status` != "Duplicate")


```

We know from the "final figure" that we want the variable `Bedroom Limit` on the y axis (response/dependent variable) and `Guest Occupancy Limit` on the x axis (explanatory/independent variable). To do this in `ggplot2` we need to make use of the `aes()`\index{aes()} function and also add a `data =` argument. `aes` is short for aesthetics, and it's the function we use to specify what we want displayed in the figure.

If we did not include the `aes()`\index{aes()} function, then the `x =` and `y =` arguments would produce an error saying that the object was not found. A good rule to keep in mind when using `ggplot2` is that the variables which we want displayed on the figure must be included in `aes()` function via the `mapping =` argument (corresponding to the mapping layer from Figure. 4.1).

All features in the figure which alter the displayed information, not based on a variable in our dataset (e.g. increasing the size of points to an arbitrary value), is included outside of the `aes()` function. Don't worry if that doesn't make sense for now, we'll come back to this later.

Let's update our code to include the 'data' and 'mapping' layers (indicated by the grey Data and mustard Mapping *layer bubbles* which will precede relevant code chunks):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/data_mapping.png")
```

```{r ggplot-with-xy-axis, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
# Including aesthetics for x and y axes as well as specifying the dataset
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`), data = df)
```

 

That's already much better. At least it's no longer a blank grey canvas. We've now told `ggplot2` what we want as our x and y axes as well as where to find that data. But what's missing here is where we tell `ggplot2` *how* to display that data. This is now the time to introduce you to 'geoms' or geometry layers.

Geometries are the way that `ggplot2` displays information. For instance `geom_point()`\index{geom\_point()} tells `ggplot2` that you want the information to be displayed as points (making scatterplots possible for example). Given that the "final figure" uses points, this is clearly the appropriate geom to use here. But since I know that lots of values are repeated, I want to jitter the points to avoid overplotting.

Before we can do that, we need to talk about the coding structure used by `ggplot2`. The analogy that we and many others use is to say that making a figure in `ggplot2` is much like painting. What we've did in the above code was to make our "canvas". Now we are going to add sequential layers to that painting, increasing the complexity and detail over time. Each time we want to include a new layer we need to end a preceding layer with a `+` at the end to tell `ggplot2` that there are additional layers coming.

Let's add (`+`) a new geometry layer now:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/geoms.png")
```

```{r ggplot-with-geom_point, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`), data = df)  +
		geom_jitter()     # Adding a geom to display data as point data
```

 

When you first start using `ggplot2` there are three crucial layers that require your input. You can safely ignore the other layers initially as they all receive sensible (if sometimes ugly) defaults. The three crucial layers are:

 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Data - the information we want to plot"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/data.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Mapping - which variables we want displayed and where"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/mapping.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Geometry - how we want that data displayed"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/geoms.png")
```

 

Given that 'data' only requires us to specify the dataset we want to use, it is trivially easy to complete. 'Mapping' only requires you to specify what variables in the data to use, often just the x- and y-axes (specified using `aes()`). Lastly, 'geometry' is where we choose how we want the data to be visualised.

With just these three fundamentals, you will be able to produce a large variety of plots (see later in this Chapter for a [bestiary](#bestiary) of plots).

If what we wanted was a quick and dirty figure to get a grasp of the trend in the data we can stop here. From the scatterplot that we've produced, we can see that `Bedroom Limit` looks like it's increasing with `Guest Occupancy Limit` in a linear fashion. So long as this answers the question we were asking from these data, we have a figure that is fit for purpose. However, for showing to other people we might want something a bit more developed. We can include lines using a geom. If you have a quick look through the available geoms [here][geoms], `geom_smooth` with linear smoothing is appropriate.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/geoms.png")
```

```{r geom_line, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`), data = df)  +
		geom_jitter()  + 
	  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') # Add geom_line
```

 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/geoms_statistics.png")
```

 

We need to alter `geom_smooth()` so that it draws lines for each combination of `Residential Subtype`, `Permit Type` and `Current Status`. Getting `ggplot2` to do that is pretty straightforward. First , we can use the `colour =` argument within `aes()` (remember whatever we include in `aes()`\index{aes()} will be something displayed in the figure) to tell `ggplot2` to draw a different coloured lines depending on the `Permit Type` variable. Keep in mind that we have no variable in our dataset called "Permit Type_colour", so `ggplot2` is taking care of that for us here and assigning a colour to each unique Permit Type level.

An aside: `ggplot2` was written with both UK English and American English in mind, so both `colour` and `color` spellings work in `ggplot2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/mapping_scales.png")
```

```{r geom_smooth-colour-lm, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`), data = df)  +
		geom_jitter(aes(color = `Permit Type`))  + 
	  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

 

We're getting closer, especially since `ggplot2` has automatically created a legend for us. At this point it's a good time to talk about where to include information - whether to include it within a geom or in the main call to `ggplot()`. When we include information such as `data =` and `aes()` in `ggplot()` we are setting those as the default, universal values which all subsequent geoms use. Whereas if we were to include that information within a geom, only that geom would use that specific information. In this case, we can easily move the information around and get exactly the same figure.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/data_mapping.png")
```

```{r universal-vrs-geom, out.width="75%", fig.align="center", message=FALSE}
ggplot() +
	# Moved aes() and data into geoms
  geom_jitter(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`), 
  						data = df, method = "lm")
```

 

Doing so we get exactly the same figure. This ability to move information between the main `ggplot()`\index{ggplot()} call or in specific geoms is surprisingly powerful (although sometime confusing!). It can allow different geoms to display different (albeit similar) information (see more on this later).

For this worked example, we'll move the same information back to the universal `ggplot()`, but we'll also move `colour = nitrogen` into `ggplot()` so that we can have the points coloured according to nitrogen concentration as well.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/data_mapping.png")
```

```{r universal-colours, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	# Moved aes() and data into ggplot
  geom_jitter(data = df) +
  geom_smooth( method = "lm")
```

 

This figure is now what we would consider to be the typical `ggplot2` figure (once you know to look for it, you'll see it everywhere). We have specified some information, with only a few lines of code, yet we have something that looks quite attractive. While it's not yet the "final figure" it's perfectly suited for displaying the information we need from these data. You have now created your first "pure" `ggplot` using only the 'data', 'mapping' and 'geom' layers (as well as others indirectly).

Let's keep going as we're aiming for something a bit more "sophisticated".

### Wrapping grids

Having made our "pure" `ggplot`, the next big obstacle we're going to tackle is the grid like layout of the "final figure" where our main figure has been split according to the `treat` and `block` variables, with new trends shown for each combination.

Each of these panels (technically "multiples") are a great way to help other people understand what's going on in the data. This is especially true with large datasets which can obscure subtle trends simply because so much data is overlaid on top of each other. When we split a single figure into multiples, the same axes are used for all multiples which serve to highlight shifts in the data (data in some multiples may have inherently higher or lower values for instance).

`ggplot2` includes options for specifying the layout of plots using the 'facets' layer. We'll start off by using `facet_wrap()`\index{facet\_wrap()} to show what this does. For `facet_wrap()` to work we need to specify a formula for how the facets will be defined (see `?facet_wrap` for more details and also how to define facets without using a formula). In our example we want to use the factor `treat` to determine the layout so our formula would look like `~ treat`. You can read `~ treat` as saying "according to treatment". Let's see how it works:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/facets.png")
```

```{r facet_wrap, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter() +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_wrap( ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

That's pretty good. But we want the combination of `Residential Subtype` and `Current Status`.

While this looks pretty good, we are still missing information showing any potential effect of the different blocks. Given that `facet_wrap()` can use a formula, maybe we could simply include `block` in the formula? Remember that the `block` variable refers to the region in the greenhouse where the plants were grown. Let's try it and see what happens.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/facets.png")
```

```{r facet_wrap-formula, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter() +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_wrap(~`Current Status` +`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

This facet layout is almost exactly what we want. Close but no cigar. In this case we actually want to be using `facet_grid()`\index{facet\_grid()}, an alternative to `facet_wrap()`, which should put us back on track to make the "final figure".

*Play around*: Try changing the formula to see what happens.

Let's try using `facet_grid` instead of `facet_wrap` to produce the following plot.

 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/facets.png")
```

```{r facet_grid, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter() +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

And we're there. Although the styling is not the same as the "final figure" this is showing the same core fundamental information.The rest is about adjusting the labels, spacing, legend positions etc. Those will be covered later.

### Plotting multiple ggplots

While we've made multiples of the same figure, what if we wanted to take two completely different figures and plot them together in the same frame? As a demonstration, let's plot the last figure we made and the "final figure" shown at the start of this chapter one on top of the other to see how they compare. To do this we are going to use a package called `patchwork`\index{patchwork package}. First you will need to install and make the `patchwork` package available.

```{r loading-patchwork, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("patchwork")
library(patchwork)
```

```{r loading-patchwork_true, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
```

An important note: For those who have used base R to produce their figures and are familiar with using `par(mfrow = c(2,2))` (which allows plotting of four figures in two rows and two columns) be aware that this does not work for `ggplot2` objects. Instead you will need to use either the `patchwork` package or alternative packages such as `gridArrange` or `cowplot` or covert the `ggplot2` objects to grobs.

To plot both of the plots together we need to go back to our previous code and do something clever. We need to assign each figure to a separate object and then use these objects when we use `patchwork`. For instance, we can assigned our "final figure" plot to an object called `final_figure` (we're not very imaginative!), you haven't see the code yet so you'll just have to take our word for it!

Let's remind ourselves of the final figure.

 

```{r calling-figure-name, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
final_figure
```

 

We'll now assign the code we wrote when creating our previous plot to an object called `rbook_figure`:

 

```{r naming-figure, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
# Naming our figure object
rbook_figure <-  ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter() +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

Now when the code is run, the figure won't be shown immediately. To show the figure we need to type the name of the object. We'll do this at the same time as showing you how `patchwork` works.

An old headache when using `ggplot2` was that it could be difficult to create a nested figure (different plots, or "multiples", all part of the same dataset). `patchwork` resolves this problem very elegantly and simply. We have two immediate and simple options with patchwork; arrange figures on top of each other (specified with a `/`) or arrange figures side-by-side (specified with either a `+` or a `|`). Let's try to plot both figures, one on top of the other.

 

```{r side-by-side-patchwork, echo=TRUE, out.width = "85%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
rbook_figure / final_figure
```

 

*Play around*: Try to create a side-by-side version of the above figure (hint: try the other operators).

We can take this one step further and assign nested `patchwork` figures to an object and use this in turn to create labels for individuals figures.

 

```{r labelled-nested, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
nested_compare <- rbook_figure / final_figure

nested_compare +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A", tag_suffix = ")")
```

 

This is only the basics of what the `patchwork` package can do but there are many other uses. We won't go into them in any great detail here, but later in the [tips and tricks](#tips) section we'll show you some more cool features.

### Make it your own

While we already have a great figure showing the main aspects of our data, it uses many default layer options. Whilst the default options are fine we may want to change them to get our plot looking exactly how we want it. Maybe we're going to use this figure in a presentation and we want to make sure someone in the very back of the room can easily read the figure. Maybe we want to use our own colour scheme. Maybe we want to change the grey background to a nice bright neon pink. In essence, maybe we want to decide things for ourselves. This next section will go through how to customise the appearance of our figure.

Let's start with the easier stuff, namely changing the size of the plotting symbols using the `size =` argument. Before we do, have a think about where we'd include this argument? Should it be in main call to `ggplot()`\index{ggplot()} or in the `geom_jitter()` geom? Does size depend on a variable in our dataset and is therefore something we want displayed on the figure (meaning we should include it within `aes()`)? Or is it merely changing the appearance of information?

Let's include it in the `geom_jitter` geom

 

```{r change-size, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( size = 2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

Pretty straight forward, we changed the size from the default of `size = 1` to a value that we decide for ourselves. What happens if you included size in `ggplot()` or within the `aes()` of `geom_jitter()`?

If we wanted to change the shape of the plotting symbols to reflect the different Permit Status (Pending, Issued), how do you think we'd do that? We'd use the `shape =` argument, but this time we need to include an `aes()` within `geom_jitter()` because we want to include specific information to be displayed on the figure.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/scales_mapping.png")
```

```{r change-shape, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter(aes(shape = `Current Status`), size = 3) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

Try including \`shape = ``` Current Status\`` without also including ```aes()\`\index{aes()} and see what happens.

We're edging our way closer to our "final figure". Another thing we may want to be able to do is change the transparency of the points. While it's not actually that useful here, changing the transparency of points is really valuable when you have lots of data resulting in clusters of points obscuring information. Doing this is easily accomplished using the `alpha =` argument. Again, ask yourself where you think the `alpha =` argument should be included (hint: you should put it in the `geom_jitter` geom!).

 

```{r change-alpha, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`)
```

 

To get the facet labels to wrap correctly we need to use a labeller function within `facet_grid`.

```{r add_labeller, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`,
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) 
```

We can also include user defined labels for the x and y axis. There are a couple of ways to do this, but a more familiar way may be to use the same syntax as used in base R figures; using `xlab()`\index{xlab()} and `ylab()`\index{ylab()}. We'll specify that these belong to the `ggplot` by using the `+` symbol.

 

```{r axis-labels, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")
```

 

Great. Let's now work on the legend title while also including a caption to warn people looking at the figure to treat the trend lines with caution. We'll use a new layer called `labs()`\index{labs()}, short for labels, which we could have also used for specifying the x and y axes labels (we didn't only for demonstration purposes, but give it a shot). `labs()` is a fairly straightforward function. Have a look at the help file (using `?labs`) to see which arguments are available. We'll be using `caption =` argument for our caption, but notice that there isn't a single simple argument for `legend =`? That's because the legend actually contains multiple pieces of information; such as the colour and shape of the symbols. So instead of `legend =` we'll use `colour =` .

I want to introduce a line break in Colour label in `Permit Type`. `\\n` is newline character. Here's how we do it:

```{r other-labels, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								labs(colour = "Permit\nType")
```

 

We can now move onto some more wholesale-stylistic choices using the themes layer.

### Setting the theme

Themes control the general style of a `ggplot` (things like the background colour, size of text etc.) and comes with a whole bunch of predefined themes. Let's play around with themes using some skills we've already learnt; assigning plots to an object and plotting multiple `ggplots` in a single figure using `patchwork`. We assign themes by creating a new layer with the general notation - `theme_NameOfTheme()`. For example, to use the `theme_classic`\index{theme\_classic()}, `theme_bw`\index{theme\_bw()}, `theme_minimal`\index{theme\_minimal()} and `theme_light`\index{theme\_light()} themes.

To make the figure visible, I am supressing the legend using `guides(color = "none")`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/theme.png")
```

```{r testing-themes, out.width = "85%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
classic <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								guides(color = "none") +
	# Classic theme
	theme_classic()

bw <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								guides(color = "none") +
	# Black and white theme
	theme_bw()

minimal <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								guides(color = "none")+
	
	# Minimal theme
	theme_minimal()

light <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								guides(color = "none")+
	
	# Light theme
	theme_light()

(classic | bw) /
	(minimal | light)
```

 

In terms of finding a theme that most closely matches our "final figure", it's probably going to be `theme_classic()`\index{theme\_classic()}. There are additional themes available to you, and even more available online. `ggthemes`\index{ggthemes package} is a package which contains many more themes for you to use. The BBC even have their own `ggplot2` theme called "BBplot" which they use when making their own figures (while good, we don't like it too much for scientific figures). Indeed, you can even make your own theme which is what we'll work on next. To begin with, we'll have a look to see how `theme_classic()` was coded. We can do that easily enough by just writing the function name without the parentheses (see [Chapter 7](#prog_r) for a bit more on this).

```{r theme_classic, message=FALSE, comment="", collapse=TRUE}
theme_classic
```

Let's use this code as the basis for our own theme and modify it according to our needs. We'll call the theme, `theme_rbook`. Not all of the options will immediately make sense, but don't worry about this too much for now. Just know that the settings we're putting in place are:

 

-   Font size for axis titles = 13
-   Font size for x axis text = 10
-   Font size for y axis text = 10
-   Font for caption = 10 and italics
-   Background colour = white
-   Background border = black
-   Axis lines = black
-   Strip colour (for facets) = light blue
-   Strip text colour (for facets) = black
-   Legend box colours = No colour
-   Legend position = bottom

 

This is by no means an exhaustive list of features you can specify in your own theme, but this will get you started. Of course, there's no need to use a personalised theme as the pre-built options are perfectly suitable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/theme.png")
```

```{r rbook-theme, message=FALSE}
theme_rbook <- function(base_size = 13, base_family = "", base_line_size = base_size/22, 
                         base_rect_size = base_size/22) {         
  theme( 
    axis.title = element_text(size = 13),                               
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),                              
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),                              
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic"),            
    panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"),                      
    axis.line = element_line(size = 1, colour = "black"),
    strip.background =element_rect(fill = "#cddcdd"),
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=0.5),
		strip.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
		legend.key=element_blank(),
		legend.position = "bottom"
		)
 
}
```

 

`theme_rbook()`\index{theme\_rbook()} is now available for us to use just like any other theme. Let's try remaking our figure using our new theme.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/theme.png")
```

```{r rbook-figure, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								labs(colour = "Permit\nType") +
	# Updated theme to our theme_rbook
	theme_rbook()   # use our new theme
```

 

### Prettification

We've pretty much replicated our "final figure". We just have a few final adjustments to make, and we'll do so in order of difficulty.

Let's remind ourselves of what that "final figure" looked like. Remember, since we've previously stored the figure as an object called `final_figure` we can just type that into the console and pull up the figure.

 

```{r final-figure-reminder, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
final_figure + 
	labs(title = "Reminder of the final figure")
```

 

The only things left to do are to change the colour and the shape of the points to something of our choosing and include information on the "overall" trend line in the legend. We'll begin with the former; changing colour and shape to something we specifically want. When we first started using `ggplot2` this was the thing which caused us the most difficulty. We think the reason is, that to manually change the colours actually requires an additional layer, where we assumed this would be done in either the main call to `ggplot()` or in a geom.

Instead of doing this within the specific geom, we'll use `scale_colour_manual()`\index{scale\_colour\_manual()} as well as `scale_shape_manual()`\index{scale\_shape\_manual()}. Doing it this way will allow us to do two things at once; change the shape and colour to our choosing, and assign labels to these (much like what we did with `xlab()` and `ylab()`). Doing so is not too complex but will require nesting a function (`c()`\index{c()}) within our `scale_colour_manual` and `scale_shape_manual` functions (see [Chapter 2](#basics_r) for a reminder on the concatenate function (`c()`) if you've forgotten).

Choosing colours can be fiddly. We've found using a colour wheel helps with this step. You can always use Google to find an interactive colour wheel, or use Google's Colour picker. Any decent website should give you a HEX code, something like: #5C1AAE which is a "code" representation of a colour. Alternatively, there are colour names which R and `ggplot2` will also understand (e.g. "firebrick4"). Having chosen our colours using whichever means, let's see how we can do it:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/scales.png")
```

```{r scale-manual, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
final_figure <- ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
	                geom_jitter( alpha=0.6, size =2) +
									geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
	                facet_grid(`Current Status` ~`Residential Subtype`, 
	                					 labeller = labeller(`Residential Subtype` = label_wrap_gen(10))) +
									xlab("Max. Guests") +
									ylab("Max. Bedrooms")+
  								labs(colour = "Permit\nType") +
									scale_colour_manual(
    									values = c("#5C1AAE", "#AE5C1A", "#1AAE5C")) +
  								theme_rbook() 
	
```

 

To make sense of that code (or any code for that matter) try running it piece by piece. For instance in the above code, if we run `c("#5C1AAE", "#AE5C1A", "#1AAE5C")` we'll get a list of those strings. That list is then passed on to `scale_colour_manual()` as the colours we wish to use. Since we only have three `Permit Types`, it will use these three colours. Try including an additional colour in the list and see what happens (if you place the new colour at the end of the list, nothing will happen since it will use the first three colours of the list - try adding it to the start of the list).

And we've done it! Our final figure matches the "final figure" exactly. We can then save the final figure to our computer so that we can include it in a poster etc. The code for this is straightforward, but does require an understanding of file paths. Be sure to check [Chapter 1](#work-d) for an explanation if you're unsure. To save `ggplot` figures to an external file we use the function `ggsave`.

This is the point when having assigned the code to the object named `rbook_figure` comes in handy. Doing so allows us to specify which figure to save within `ggsave()`\index{ggsave()}. If we hadn't specified which plot to save, `ggsave()` would instead save the last figure produced.

Other important arguments to take note of are: `device =` which tells `ggplot2` what format we want to save the figure (in this case a pdf) though `ggplot2` is often smart enough to guess this based on the extension we give our file name, so it is often redundant; `units =` which specifies the units used in `width =` and `height =`; `width =` and `height =` specify the width and height of figure (in this case in mm as specified using `units =`); `dpi =` which controls the resolution of the saved figure; and `limitsize =` which prevents accidentally saving a massive figure of 1 km x 1 km!

```{r ggsave, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "maxbedrooms_occupancylimit_facet.pdf", plot = final_figure, device = "pdf", 
			 path = "output", width = 250, height = 150, units = "mm", 
			 dpi = 500, limitsize = TRUE)
```

This concludes the worked example to reproduce our final figure. While absolutely not an exhaustive list of what you can do with `ggplot2`, this will hopefully help when you're making your own from scratch or, perhaps likely when starting, copying `ggplots` made by other people (in which case hopefully this will help you understand what they've done).

Two sections follow this one. The first is simply a collection of tips and tricks that couldn't quite make their way into this worked example, and the second section is a collection of different geometries to give you a feel for what's possible. We would recommend only glancing through each section and coming back to them as and when you need to know how to do *that particular thing*.

Hopefully you've enjoyed reading through this Chapter, and more importantly, that it's increased your confidence in making figures. Here are two final parting *words of wisdom!*. First, as we've said before, don't fall into the trap of thinking your figures are superior to those who don't use `ggplot2`. As we've mentioned previously, equivalent figures are possible in both base R and `ggplot2`. The only difference is how you get to those figures.

Secondly, don't overcomplicate your figures. With regards to the final figure we produced here, we've gone back and forth as to whether we are guilty of this. The figure does contain a lot of information, drawing on information from five different variables, with one of those being presented in three different ways. We would be reluctant, for example, to include this in a presentation as it would likely be too much for an audience to fully appreciate in the 30 seconds to 1 minute that they'll see it. In the end we decided it was worth the risk as it served as a nice demonstration. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on your view, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to making figures. Much of it will be at your discretion, so please ensure you give it some thought.

## Tips and tricks {#tips}

For this section we'll use various versions of the final figure without including the `facet_grid()`\index{facet\_grid()}. We do so only to allow the changes to be more apparent. With this plot, we'll run through some tips and tricks that we wish we'd learnt when we started using `ggplot2`.

### Statistics layer

The statistics layer is often ignored in favour of working solely with the geometry layer, as we've done above. The two are largely interchangeable, though the relative rareness of online help and discussions on the statistics layer seems to have relegated it to almost a state of anonymity. There is real value in at least understanding what the statistics layer is doing, even if you don't ever need to make direct use of it. It is perhaps most clear what the statistical layer is doing in the early `geom_smooth()`\index{geom\_smooth()} figure we made.

 

```{r stat-layer}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

 

Nowhere in our dataset are there columns for either the y-intercept or the gradient needed to draw the straight line, yet we've managed to draw one. The statistics layer calculates these based on our data, without us necessarily knowing what we've done. It's also the engine behind converting your data into counts for producing a bar chart, or densities for violin plots, or summary statistics for boxplots and so on.

It's entirely possible that you'll be able to use `ggplot2` for the vast majority of you plotting without ever consulting the statistics layer in any more detail than we have here (simply by "calling" - unknowingly - to it via the geometry layer), but be aware that it exists.

If we wanted to recreate the above figure using the statistics layer we would do it like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/statistics.png")
```

```{r stat_smooth-lm, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
  geom_jitter() +
	# using stat_smooth instead of geom_smooth
  stat_smooth(geom = "smooth", method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

 

While in this example it doesn't make a difference which we use, in other cases we may want to use the calculated statistics in alternative ways. We won't get into it, but see `?after_stat` if you are interested.

### Axis limits and zooms

Fairly often, you may want to limit the range of your axes. Maybe you want to focus a particular part of the data to really tease apart any patterns occurring there. Whatever the reason, it's a useful skill, and with most things code related, there's a couple of ways to do this. We'll show two here; `xlim()`\index{xlim()} and `ylim()`\index{ylim()}, and `coord_cartesian()`\index{coord\_cartesian()}. Using both of these we'll set the x axis to only show data between 10 and 15 g and the y axis to only show the area of the shoot between 50 and 150 mm^2^. We'll start with limiting the axes:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/coords.png")
```

```{r axis-limits, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
	# New x and y limits
	xlim(c(4, 8)) +
	ylim(c(2, 4))
```

 

A alternative method `coord_cartesian()`. However, there are pretty big differences.`coord_cartesian()` works in much the same way, but instead of chopping out data, it instead zooms in. Doing so means that the entire dataset is maintained (and any trends are maintained). In particular it matters of `geom_smooth` or `stat_*`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/coords.png")
```

```{r coord_cartesian, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Permit Type`), data = df) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+
	# Zooming in rather than chopping out
	coord_cartesian(xlim = c(4, 8),	ylim = c(2, 4))
```

 

Notice now that the trends are maintained (as the lines are being informed by data which are off-screen). We would generally advise using `coord_cartesian()` as it protects you against possible misinterpretations.

### Layering layers

Remember that `ggplot2` works like painting. Let's imagine we were one of the great renaissance painters. We've just finished the focal point of our painting, the half naked Duke of Toulouse looking moody or something. Now that we've finished painting the honourable Duke, we proceed to paint the background, a beautiful landscape showing the Pyrenees mountains in the distance. Unfortunately, in doing so we've painted over the Duke because the order of our layers was wrong. We get our heads chopped off, but learn a valuable lesson in the process: the order of layers matter.

The exact same is true in `ggplot2` (minus the chopping off of heads, though your situation may vary). The layers are read and "painted" in order of their appearance in the code. If `geom_point()`\index{geom\_point()} comes before `geom_col()`\index{geom\_col()}, then your points may well end up being hidden. To fix this is easy, we simply need to move the layers up or down in the code. A useful tip for those using Rstudio, is that you can move lines of code especially easily. Simply click on a line of code, hold down Alt and then press either the up or down arrows, and the entire line will move up or down as well. For multiple lines of code, simply highlight all those lines you want to move and press Alt + Up/Down arrow.

### Continuous colours

Instead of categorical colours, such as we've used for `Permit Type`, what if instead we wanted a gradient? To illustrate this, we'll remove the trend lines to highlight the changes we make. We'll also be using the `Bedroom Limit` variable to specify the colour that points should be coloured. We have three options that we'll use here; the default colour scheme, the `scale_colour_gradient()`\index{scale\_colour\_gradient()} scheme, and an alternative scheme`scale_colour_gradient2()`\index{scale\_colour\_gradient2()}. Remember that we'll also need to change our label for the legend.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="7.5%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/scales.png")
```

```{r continuous-colour, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center", message=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = `Guest Occupancy Limit`, y = `Bedroom Limit`, color = `Bedroom Limit`), data = df) +
  geom_jitter() +
  	# Adding scale_colour_gradient
	scale_colour_gradient(low = "#9F00FF", high = "#FF9F00") 

```
